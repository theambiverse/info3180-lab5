<p ><h4>Alone</h4><br>
    <q>From childhood’s hour I have not been<br>
    As others were—I have not seen<br>
    As others saw—I could not bring<br>
    My passions from a common spring—<br>
    From the same source I have not taken<br>
    My sorrow—I could not awaken<br>
    My heart to joy at the same tone—<br>
    And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—<br>
    Then—in my childhood—in the dawn<br>
    Of a most stormy life—was drawn<br>
    From ev’ry depth of good and ill<br>
    The mystery which binds me still—<br>
    From the torrent, or the fountain—<br>
    From the red cliff of the mountain—<br>
    From the sun that ’round me roll’d<br>
    In its autumn tint of gold—<br>
    From the lightning in the sky<br>
    As it pass’d me flying by—<br>
    From the thunder, and the storm—<br>
    And the cloud that took the form<br>
    (When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br>
    Of a demon in my view—</q><br>
